Graph ML for Chip Profiling. **Mentor: Lindsey Kostas**

**What is the most interesting topic covered in your domain this quarter?**
The most interesting topic covered in my domain is defnitely the design of GNN. We have the chance to discuss and learn the building and theoretical process of building a GNN from scratch.
Furthermore, we also learnt the basic of chip design such as the position and the type of gates and some hot topics people are thinking in chip design industry.

**Describe a potential investigation you would like to pursue for your Quarter 2 Project.**
Currently, our team is focusing on developing a pipeline for congestion predicion. We want to make a pipeline which is more efficient on feature engineering and give more explainable output.
Constructing a more accurate model is also what we are thinking about.

**What is a potential change youâ€™d make to the approach taken in your current Quarter 1 Project?**
Maybe narrow down our project a bit? Like I mentioned in last question, we are thinking to build a pipeline but it requires a tons of time to learn the corresponding topic and debug. 
We werer worrying about the time. One potential change we are thinking is to narrow our project to one specific aspect like feature engineering. 

**What other techniques would you be interested in using in your project?**
We have no clue how to build a pipeline from sractch. So we definitely want to learn more on it.
